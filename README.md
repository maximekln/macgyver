# MAZEGYVER : a 2D labyrinth game.

Help MacGyver escape the maze !




MAZEGYVER is a 2D labyrinth in which MacGyver is locked up.
The exit is blocked by a guardian whose hairstyle would make Tina Turner pale.
To distract him and escape the maze, you need to gather the following elements (scattered throughout the maze) : 
a needle, a small plastic tube and some ether.
They will allow MacGyver to create a syringe and put our guard to sleep.

## Features 

    - There is only one level. The structure (departure, location of the walls, arrival) is saved in a 
      file to be easily modified if necessary.

    - MacGyver is controlled by the directional keys on the keyboard.

    - Objects are randomly distributed in the maze and will change location if the user closes the game and restarts it.

    - The game window is a square that can display 15 sprites along its length.

    - MacGyver has to move from square to square, with 15 squares along the length of the window!

    - It will collect an object simply by moving over it.

    - The aim of MacGyver is to collect all the objects, put the guard to sleep and found the way out of the maze in 
      order to win the game. 
      If he doesn't have all the objects and presents himself in front of the guard, he dies (life is cruel for heroes).
